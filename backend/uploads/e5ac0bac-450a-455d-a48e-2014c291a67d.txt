Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Overview

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and factual responses. Instead of relying solely on the knowledge encoded in a language model's parameters, RAG systems retrieve relevant information from external knowledge bases and use that information to generate responses.

Key Components:
1. Retrieval System: Uses embeddings and vector similarity search to find relevant documents
2. Generation System: An LLM that synthesizes the retrieved information into coherent responses
3. Knowledge Base: A collection of documents, typically stored with vector embeddings

How RAG Works:
1. Query Processing: User question is converted to embeddings
2. Retrieval: Similar documents are retrieved using vector similarity search
3. Context Assembly: Retrieved documents are formatted as context
4. Generation: LLM generates response based on the retrieved context
5. Citation: Sources are tracked and provided to the user

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real documents
- Allows models to access up-to-date information
- Provides source attribution for fact-checking
- Works with smaller models since knowledge is externalized
- Can be updated without retraining the model

Common Vector Databases:
- ChromaDB (local, easy to use)
- Pinecone (managed cloud service)
- Weaviate (open source, production-ready)
- Qdrant (high-performance, Rust-based)

Chunking Strategies:
- Fixed-size chunks with overlap (common: 512 tokens, 50 token overlap)
- Semantic chunking (split on paragraph/section boundaries)
- Recursive splitting (paragraphs → sentences → tokens)

Embedding Models:
- Sentence-transformers (local, fast, good quality)
- OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (cloud-based)
- Cohere embeddings (specialized for RAG)

Challenges:
- Chunk size optimization
- Retrieval quality vs quantity
- Context window limitations
- Latency in retrieval and generation
- Cost of embeddings and LLM calls
