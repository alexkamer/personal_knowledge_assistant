# Test Document for Knowledge Assistant

## Introduction

This is a test document to verify the document upload and processing pipeline in the Personal Knowledge Assistant application.

## Key Features

The document processing system should:

1. **Upload and Store**: Accept various file formats (TXT, MD, PDF, DOCX)
2. **Extract Text**: Parse and extract text content from uploaded files
3. **Chunk Content**: Break documents into semantic chunks for better retrieval
4. **Generate Embeddings**: Create vector embeddings for each chunk
5. **Store in Vector DB**: Save embeddings in ChromaDB for similarity search

## Testing Process

When testing document upload, we should verify:

- File validation (type, size)
- Text extraction accuracy
- Chunk creation and storage
- Embedding generation
- Vector database storage
- Retrieval via semantic search

## Expected Outcomes

After successful upload:
- Document record created in PostgreSQL
- Multiple chunks generated based on content length
- Embeddings stored in ChromaDB
- Document searchable via RAG queries

## Conclusion

This test document contains enough content to generate multiple chunks and test the full document processing pipeline.
